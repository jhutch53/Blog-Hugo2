#Welcome, Welcome!
###My name is James. I am a current student at Mercyhurst University, and am enrolled in the Intelligence studies major. At the moment, this blog is simply a repository for graded material in my Data Science class. However, as Dr. Redmond suggests, I intend to turn it into a living resume for future employment opportunities.
